CSS Cascade, Selection &amp; Pseudo Selectors

# The Ultimate To-Do List

## Description
This is a dynamic and user-friendly To-Do List web application designed to help users organize tasks, track progress, and achieve their goals. The project showcases advanced CSS techniques, including pseudo-selectors (`::after`) and the use of generic selectors to enhance the visual appeal of the application.


## Features
- **Themed Background:** A visually appealing background image relevant to task management.
- **Creative Header:** A header with a meaningful title styled using an `H1` tag and CSS selectors.
- **Dynamic Lists:** Tasks are categorized into "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
- **Checkbox Functionality:**
  - Mark tasks as "In Progress" or "Done" using checkboxes.
  - Tasks are styled dynamically when checked.
  - `::after` pseudo-selector is used to add visual feedback for checked items (e.g., ‚è∞ for "In Progress" and üíØ for "Done").
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes using `flex-wrap`.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For semantic structure.
- **CSS3**: For advanced styling and dynamic updates.
- **Google Fonts**: Utilized the "Roboto" and "Poppins" font families for a modern look.

## About the Project Components

### HTML
The webpage uses basic HTML elements to build its structure, including:
- `header`: Displays the title and a brief description of the page.
- `main`: Contains three task categories: "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done".
- `article`: Each task list is enclosed in a `article` element for semantic purposes.
- `ul` and `li`: Lists are used to display tasks, with checkboxes to mark tasks as complete.

### CSS
The CSS is used to style the page, enhance layout responsiveness, and add interactive effects. Key features include:
- A background image that creates a thematic look for the page.
- Custom fonts (Roboto and Poppins) to improve text readability and design.
- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes using flexbox.
- Hover effects and color transitions to make the list interactive.
- `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to add icons for each list category and provide visual feedback for completed tasks.

### JavaScript
The JavaScript file (optional) can be used to enhance the functionality, such as:
- Saving tasks to LocalStorage to persist user data across page reloads.
- Dynamically adding or removing tasks.
- Implementing additional features like task deadlines or priority levels.
